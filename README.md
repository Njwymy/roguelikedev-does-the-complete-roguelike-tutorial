At [r/roguelikedev](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/) we're doing a dev-along following [The Complete Roguelike Tutorial](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Complete_Roguelike_Tutorial,_using_python%2Blibtcod).

This will be a rust follow along version that also uses [The Roguelike Tutorial in Rust + tcod](https://tomassedovic.github.io/roguelike-tutorial/).


Each week is split up into their own folder which will roughly follow along with what the tutorial covers. Then there is a game folder that takes what was done during the week and expands upon it.
