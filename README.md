### Rust Version

At [r/roguelikedev](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/) we're doing a dev-along following [The Complete Roguelike Tutorial](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Complete_Roguelike_Tutorial,_using_python%2Blibtcod).

This will be a rust follow along version that also uses [The Roguelike Tutorial in Rust + tcod](https://tomassedovic.github.io/roguelike-tutorial/).


Each week I will create a folder for each tutorial group that is supposed to be accomplished. In addition I will create a "extension" folder in which I will experiment with some different code changes to the tutorial that I thought of while working on the tutorial.

I expect to keep each week folder roughly same as the tutorial while the "extension" folders might diverge.
