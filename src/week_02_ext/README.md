List of changes from the original tutorial done this far week.

-Moved most of the global variables into the objects they described. (e.g. `MAP_WIDTH` into `map.width()`)
-Split up the one big file into different files.
-Changed the map from `vec<vec<tile>>` to `vec<tile>` and included some helper methods for that.
